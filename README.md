#AffectNet Scripts
Here is the some code playing around with the AffectNet dataset.
## Prerequisite
You'll need Python 3.5 on Windows or Python 2.7 on Ubuntu. Packages needed include OpenCV (`conda install opencv`), matplotlib (`conda install matplotlib`), [ibug_face_tracker](https://github.com/hhj1897/dlib_and_chehra_stuff), and maybe some other stuff along the way as the work progresses.

Also, you should put this folder within the AffectNet directory, with all images and csv files already unzipped.
